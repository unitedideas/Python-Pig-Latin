# Python-Pig-Latin
Shane's practice pig latin translator

The rules (I'm making this up as I go):

    1. Get an input from the user
    2. Words that start with a consonant - go to the first vowel and take everything before that vowel and place it at the end of the word. Example: That == atth
    3. If the word starts with a vowel - go to the next vowel and take everything before that vowel and place it at the end of the word. Example: Anaconda == acondaan
    4. Add "yay" or "ay" to the end of every word. Using the two above examples: atth == atthyay & acondaan == acondaanyay
    5. You have to have a print to screen and a text to speech output
    6. You cannot use modules to solve steps 1 - 4, but you can use on for step 5"""
