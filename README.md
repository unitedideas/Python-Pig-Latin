# Python-Pig-Latin
Shane's practice pig latin translator

The rules (I'm making this up as I go):

  1. Words that start with a consonant - go to the first vowel and take everything before that vowel and place it at the end of the word. Example: That == atth
  2. If the word starts with a vowel - go to the next vowel and take everything before that vowel and place it at the end of the 3. word. Example: Anaconda == acondaan
  4. Add "yay" to the end of every word. Using the two above examples: atth == atthyay & acondaan == acondaanyay
  5. You have to keep periods (".") and capitalize the word after the period
  6. You have to have a print to screen and a text to speech output
  7. You cannot use modules to solve steps 1 - 4, but you can use on for step 5
